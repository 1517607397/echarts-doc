#${prefix} rotate(string|number) = 'radial'

If it is `number` type, then is stands for rotation, from -90 degrees to 90 degrees, and positive values stand for counterclockwise.

Besides, it can be string `'radial'`, standing for radial rotation; or `'tangential'`, standing for tangential rotation.

By default, it is `'radial'`. If no rotation is wanted, it can be set to `0`.
